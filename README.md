I use Vue.js and my frontend framework, with Vuex as my statemanagement system, and Vuetify for design. I use Firebase Hosting to host the built webpage, and FirestoreDB for retrieving/saving any data needed. This is a low-level simple project, so I don't use all the great functionalities that these libraries and frameworks provide.
